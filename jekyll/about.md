Iâ€™m Dimitri Fourny, a french security researcher who works in the field of 
vulnerability research and exploitation.  
On this website, I try to keep all my 
blog posts and my projects even if there is a gap between the first ones and 
the last ones. I hope that it will satisfy your curiosity.
